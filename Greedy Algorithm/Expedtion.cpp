/* A group of cows grabbed a truck and ventured on an expedition deep into the jungle . The truck leak one unit of 
fuel every unit of ditance it travels.
To repair the truck , the cows need to drive to the nearest town (no more than 10e6 units distance )
Ont this road , between the town and the current location , there are N (1<=N <=10e5) fuels to stop where 
the cows can stop to  acquire additional fuel (1.......100 unit at each stop ). 
The cows want to make the minimum  possible number of stops for fuels on the way to town .
Capacity of the tank is sufficiently large to hold any amount of fuel . 
Initial units of fuel : P(1<= P<=10e6)
Initial distance from town : L

Determine the minimum no of stops to reach the town  */
